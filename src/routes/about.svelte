<h1>About 💎 Oracle</h1>

<p>Who is the Oracle? What is the Matrix? The truth is, we no longer know.</p>

<p>The Diamond Oracle is that, for us. All of us. It is open-sourced. It is free. The 💎 Oracle summarizes publicly available data from the Options market into a tool that answers target price and odds questions based on what the options market collectively implies. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
